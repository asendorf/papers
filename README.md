# Published Papers from Graduate School

This repository contains LaTeX files for each of my papers
in graduate school. Please remember to cite them if you use
them.

### Thesis - Informative Data Fusion

The `2015_thesis` directory contains files to compile my Ph.D. thesis. There
are a number of topics in the thesis, but it generally focuses on how to use
multi-modal datasets particularly in the cases of high dimensionality and
relatively small samples.
[Here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/113419) is a
link to it.

### Improved Matched Subpsace Detectors

The `2013_ieee_tsp` directory contains files to compile a journal article
in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing. This article focused on how to use
random matrix theory to create better matched subspace detectors.
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6415288) is a link
to it.

### Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis
The `2015_ieee_tit` directory contains files to compile a journal article in IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory. This article focuses on how to detect correlated
signals in low rank plus noise
datasets. [Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7903598) is a link to it.

### Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis
The `2015_asilomar_mcca` directory contains files to compile a conference publication
from 2015's Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers. This paper focuses
on extending Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (ICCA) to more than two datasets.
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7421093) is a link to it

### Improved Canonical Vectors
The `2015_asilomar_icca` directory contains files to compile a conference publication
from 2015's Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers. This paper focuses
on how the accuracy of canonical vectors in Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (ICCA).
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7421463) is a link to it.

### Signal Detection in Randomly Compressed Matrices
The `2015_asilomar_svd` directory contains files to compile a conference publication
from 2015's Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers. This paper focuses
on the performance of signal detection when we randomly project high dimensional
signals lower dimensions. 
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7421388) is a link to it

### Deterministic Matched Subspace Detectors
The `2012_ieee_ssp` directory contains files to compile a conference publication
from 2012's IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop. This paper focuses on
the performance of a matched subspace detector when our signal we are trying to
recover is deterministc and not stochastic.
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6319714) is a link to it.

### Stochastic Matched Subspace Detectors

The `2011_asilomar_msd` directory contains files to compile a conference publication
from 2011's Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers. This papers focuses
on how to use random matrix theory to build better matched subspace detectors in the
stochastic setting. [Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6190352) is
a link to it.
