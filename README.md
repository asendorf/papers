# Published Papers from Graduate School

This repository contains LaTeX files for each of my papers
in graduate school. Please remember to cite them if you use
them.

### Thesis - Informative Data Fusion

The `2015_thesis` directory contains files to compile my Ph.D. thesis. There
are a number of topics in the thesis, but it generally focuses on how to use
multi-modal datasets particularly in the cases of high dimensionality and
relatively small samples.
[Here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/113419) is a
link to it.

### Improved Matched Subpsace Detectors

The `2013_ieee_tsp` directory contains files to compile a journal article
in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing. This article focused on how to use
random matrix theory to create better matched subspace detectors.
[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6415288) is a link
to it.

### Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis

The `2015_ieee_tit` directory contains files to compile a journal article in IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory. This article focuses on how to detect correlated
signals in low rank plus noise
datasets. [Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7903598) is a link to it.
