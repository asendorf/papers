In the first part of this dissertation, we considered the classical problem of matched
subspace detection. Using insights from random matrix theory about the accuracy of
subspaces in the low-sample, high dimensional regime, we showcased the suboptimality of
the standard plug-in detector and derived a new detector that can avoid some of this
performance loss. It is amazing that random matrix theory reveals new surprises is
classically solved problems. We hope this application will continue to accelerate this
trend and that others will similarly reconsider other classical signal processing
applications in the low-sample high-dimensionality regime.

In the second part of this dissertation, we explored detecting correlations in multi-modal
datasets. Motivated by the suboptimality of canonical correlation analysis in the sample
deficient regime, we proposed informative CCA (ICCA). With this new algorithm, it is
possible to detect correlations in high-dimensional small-sample datasets. Using insights
from random matrix theory, we derived improved estimates of the canonical vectors returned
by ICCA. Finally, we extended these ideas to algorithms that handle more than two datasets
and proposed an informative version of such algorithms. We verified these informative
correlation algorithms on new low-rank real-world datasets that we created.

The correlation algorithms considered herein are all linear. The work presented in this
thesis unifies and completes much of the theory on linear correlation detection in the
sample deficient regime. However, if there are nonlinear correlations present between the
datasets, ICCA and IMCCA are the wrong algorithms to use. An important area of future
research is to extend these insights from random matrix theory to the kernel versions of
CCA (KCCA). While KCCA has been used in practice, the theoretical limits of it are
generally unknown. An important first step is to develop a universal data model that
encodes non-linear correlations. Ideally, similar to the work present in this thesis, we
would like to see a fundamental limit dependent on the system dimensionality, number of
samples, data SNR, and choice of kernel parameters. One can expect KCCA to have a similar
poor behavior in this sample deficient regime as CCA and so an informative version of
KCCA seems within reach.

Finally, we hope that the work on MCCA presented in the final chapter will serve as a
springboard for future research in the area. We showcased that reliable detection of
correlations between more than two datasets is possible in the sample deficient
regime. However, further investigation into the theoretical properties of such algorithms
is necessary. In the thesis we touched on the close relationship between the algorithms
MAXVAR and MINVAR. Further exploration of this relationship is very important as it may
reveal structure in the problem that we can exploit. Similar to the work presented for
ICCA, improved estimates of MCCA canonical vectors seems within reach.

Today's technological landscape offers the ability to collect as much data as possible. It
is our job as machine learning and statistical signal processing specialists to
theoretically fuse such a wide variety of data. We hope that the work presented in this
thesis serves as a starting point for such a discussion.
