We investigate, using first principles, the performance of a deterministic
signal-plus-noise versus noise detector. Our careful analysis of the test statistic's
conditional distributions reveals when non-zero signal components are useful and improve
detector performance and when they are useless and degrade detector performance. This
paper brings the importance of component selection into sharper focus so that
practitioners can become more aware of factors affecting detection performance.
