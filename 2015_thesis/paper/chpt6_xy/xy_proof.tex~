% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent

% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)

%received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering:systems from the University of Michigan in 2012.

%He is a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His research interests include the need for data driven algorithms in statistical signal processing and machine learning particularly in low SNR and sample starved settings.

%is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He received his PhD in 2007 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He was awarded an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2011, an Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award in 2012 and the Signal Processing Society Best Young Author Paper Award in 2012. His research focuses on developing theory for random matrices for applications such in signal processing, machine learning, queuing theory and scattering theory.
