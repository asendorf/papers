received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering:systems from the University of Michigan in 2012.

He is a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His research interests include the need for data driven algorithms in statistical signal processing and machine learning particularly in low SNR and sample starved settings.
