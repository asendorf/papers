ASILOMAR: We consider a stochastic  matched subspace detection problem where the signal subspace is unknown and estimated by taking the eigenvalue decomposition of the sample covariance matrix of noisy signal-bearing training data. In moderate to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes or in the setting where the number of samples is limited, subspace estimation errors affect the performance of matched subspace detectors. We use random matrix theory to derive an optimal matched subspace detector which accounts for these estimation errors and to analytically predict the associated ROC performance curves. What emerges from the analysis is the importance of using only the $k_\text{eff} \leq k$ \textit{informative} signal subspace components that can be reliably estimated from the noisy, limited data. Specifically, the ROC analysis shows that the performance of the optimal detector matches that of the plug-in detector that uses exactly $k_\text{eff}$ components. The analytical predictions are validated using numerical simulations.

SSP:We consider a matched subspace detection problem where a signal vector residing in an unknown low-rank $k$ subspace is to be detected using a subspace estimate obtained from noisy signal-bearing training data with missing entries. The resulting subspace estimate is inaccurate due to limited training data, missing entries, and additive noise. Recent results from random matrix theory (RMT) precisely quantify these subspace estimation errors for the setting where the signal has low coherence. We analytically quantify the ROC performance of the resulting plug-in detector and derive an optimal detector which explicitly accounts for these subspace estimation errors. The realized increase in performance can be attributed to the optimal detector only using the $k_\text{eff}\leq k$ ``informative'' signal subspace components. The fraction of observed entries determines $k_\text{eff}$ via a simple relationship that we describe. Detection performance better than random guessing is only achievable when the percent of observed data is above a critical threshold which we explicitly characterize.

We explore the performance of the matched subspace detector where a signal vector is assumed to reside in an unknown low-rank subspace which must be estimated from noisy signal-bearing training data.
