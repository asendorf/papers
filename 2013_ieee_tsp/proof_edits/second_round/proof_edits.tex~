\noindent{To whom it may concern,}

Could you please make the following changes to the proof
\begin{itemize}
  \item Page 5, last paragraph in first column starting with ``The detector
    derivations...'' - This is a continuation of the previous paragraph. Please delete the
    indentation, i.e., please make the first line left aligned with the column as well.
  \item Page 7, second column, last centered equation, beginning with
    ``$\Lambda(\widehat{w})=\widehat{w}^H BA...$''. Please remove the $\times$ in the middle of this equation.
  \item Page 8, equation (23). Please split this equation after the comma and
    horizontally align the equations so it looks like.
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{aligned}
        & \Lambda(\widehat{w})|H_0\sim\sum_{i=1}^{\widehat{k}}d_i\chi_{1i}^2,\\
        & \Lambda(\widehat{w})|H_1\sim\sum_{i=1}^{\widehat{k}}d_i\left(\sigma_i^2|\langle
          u_i, \widehat{u}_i\rangle|^2 +1\right)\chi_{1i}^2\\
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    The code or this is
\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{aligned}
        & \Lambda(\widehat{w})|H_0\sim\sum_{i=1}^{\widehat{k}}d_i\chi_{1i}^2,\\
        & \Lambda(\widehat{w})|H_1\sim\sum_{i=1}^{\widehat{k}}d_i\left(\sigma_i^2|\langle
          u_i, \widehat{u}_i\rangle|^2 +1\right)\chi_{1i}^2\\
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
\end{verbatim}

  \item Page 13, last line before equation (30). Please add a space between [20] and
    $\widehat{\lambda}_i$.
  \item Page 13, last paragraph, second column right before references. Please make
    changes in the appendix as indicated on the next page in red:
  \item Page 14, biography of Nicholas Asendorf, second paragraph should begin ``He is
    currently working towards his Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical...''. Please add
    ``...his Ph.D. at''.
\end{itemize}

\newpage 
Thank you very much. Please do not hesitate to email or call me directly at
asendorf@umich.edu or 443-605-3018. We would also like to preview the final proof before publication.\\
