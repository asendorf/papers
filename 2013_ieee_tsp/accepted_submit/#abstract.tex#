We analyze the performance of a matched subspace detector (MSD) where the test signal vector is assumed to reside in an unknown, low-rank $k$ subspace that must be estimated from finite, noisy, signal-bearing training data. \textcolor{blue}{Under both a stochastic and deterministic model for the test vector, subspace estimation errors due to limited training data degrade the performance of the standard plug-in detector, relative to that of an oracle detector. To avoid some of this performance loss, we utilize and extend recent results from random matrix theory (RMT) that precisely quantify the quality of the subspace estimate as a function of the eigen-SNR, dimensionality of the system, and the number of training samples. We exploit this knowledge of the subspace estimation accuracy to derive from first-principles a new RMT detector and to characterize the associated ROC performance curves of the RMT and plug-in detectors. Using more than the a critical number of \textit{informative} components, which depends on the training sample size and eigen-SNR parameters of training data, will result in a performance loss that our analysis quantifies in the large system limit.  We validate our asymptotic predictions with simulations on moderately sized systems.}

%We consider both the case where the signal is placed randomly in the unknown subspace and the case where the signal is placed deterministically at an unknown location in the unknown subspace. In the high-dimensional limited-sample setting or in regimes of moderate to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the subspace estimate is inaccurate. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to precisely quantify these subspace estimation errors and characterize the ROC performance of detectors whose test statistic is of the form $w^HDw$. One such detector, the standard plug-in detectors, assumes that the subspace estimate is exact. We show that, in certain regimes, this assumption results in a performance loss. Using the subspace estimation accuracy provided by RMT, we derive a new RMT detector which avoids the performance losses associated with the plug-in detector. Using numerical simulations, we verify our ROC predictions, validate the accuracy of the RMT approximations, and highlight the optimality of using the $k_\text{eff}$ \textit{informative} signal subspace components.
