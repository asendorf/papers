% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Nicholas Asendorf}
%received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering:systems from the University of Michigan in 2012.

%He is a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His research interests include the need for data driven algorithms in statistical signal processing and machine learning particularly in low SNR and sample starved settings.

%\begin{IEEEbiography}{Raj Rao Nadakuditi}
%received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Lafayette College, Easton, PA, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
%in electrical engineering and oceanographic engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Applied Ocean Science and Engineering in 2001 and 2007, respectively.

%He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in September 2009, where he is currently an Assistant Professor. His research interests are in the general area of statistical signal processing with an emphasis on the application of random matrix theory for high-dimensional problems that arise in the context of radar, sonar, wireless communications, and machine learning.
